                    Throughout my time in education and beyond, I've gained valuable 
                    experience and worked on a range of projects. These opportunities 
                    have not only allowed me to explore new areas of interest and learn 
                    different coding languages but also sharpened my problem-solving skills. 
                    Each experience has helped me tackle complex challenges, enhancing my ability 
                    to approach problems creatively and effectively.

                                My masterâ€™s research project was a coding-focused endeavour, 
                                completed over 11 weeks, where I simulated blastwaves from astrophysical 
                                sources. This experience not only demonstrated to me the vast potential of 
                                coding but also solidified my passion for it. To view my final report

                                into a nine-month role where I not only strengthened my C programming skills 
                                but also developed key communication, problem-solving, and leadership abilities.
